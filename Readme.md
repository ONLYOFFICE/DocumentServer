## Overview

ONLYOFFICE Document Server is a free collaborative online office suite comprising viewers and editors for texts, spreadsheets and presentations, fully compatible with Office Open XML formats: .docx, .xlsx, .pptx and enabling collaborative editing in real time.

Starting from version 6.0, Document Server is distributed under a new name - ONLYOFFICE Docs. 

ONLYOFFICE Docs can be used as a part of [ONLYOFFICE Workspace](#onlyoffice-workspace) or with third-party sync&share solutions (e.g. Nextcloud, ownCloud, Seafile) to enable collaborative editing within their interface.

It has three editions - [Community, Enterprise, and Developer](#onlyoffice-docs-editions). 

## Components

ONLYOFFICE Document Server contains the following components:

* [server](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/server "server") - the backend server software layer which is the base for all other components of ONLYOFFICE Document Server.

Enterprise Edition and Developer Edition versions include integrated test examples (simplest DMS to test the editors).   
For Community version, please use the [ONLYOFFICE Community Server](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/CommunityServer/) or [check out integration](https://www.onlyoffice.com/connectors.aspx) with 3rd party platforms, e.g. ownCloud/Nextcloud

\** Support for all conditions and gradient. Adding/Editing capabilities are coming soon
