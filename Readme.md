## Welcome to the ONLYOFFICE Docs repo!

[ONLYOFFICE Docs](https://www.onlyoffice.com/office-suite.aspx?utm_source=github&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=GitHubDS)* is a free collaborative online office suite comprising viewers and editors for texts, spreadsheets, presentations, forms, PDFs, and diagrams. It is fully compatible with Office Open XML formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) and enables collaborative editing in real time.

ONLYOFFICE Docs can be used as a part of  [ONLYOFFICE DocSpace](https://www.onlyoffice.com/docspace.aspx?utm_source=github&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=GitHubCS) and [ONLYOFFICE Workspace](https://www.onlyoffice.com/workspace.aspx?utm_source=github&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=GitHubCS), or with [third-party sync&share solutions](https://www.onlyoffice.com/all-connectors.aspx?utm_source=github&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=GitHubDS) (e.g. Odoo, Moodle, Nextcloud, ownCloud, Seafile, etc.) to enable collaborative editing within their interface.

ONLYOFFICE Docs is available in three tailored editions to suit your needs: [Community, Enterprise, and Developer](#onlyoffice-docs-editions). 

\* Starting from version 6.0, Document Server is distributed under a new name - ONLYOFFICE Docs.
