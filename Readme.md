## Overview

[ONLYOFFICE Docs](https://www.onlyoffice.com/office-suite.aspx?utm_source=github&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=GitHubDS)* is a free collaborative online office suite comprising viewers and editors for texts, spreadsheets and presentations, forms and PDF, fully compatible with Office Open XML formats: .docx, .xlsx, .pptx and enabling collaborative editing in real time.

ONLYOFFICE Docs can be used as a part of [ONLYOFFICE Workspace](https://www.onlyoffice.com/workspace.aspx?utm_source=github&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=GitHubCS) or with [third-party sync&share solutions](https://www.onlyoffice.com/all-connectors.aspx?utm_source=github&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=GitHubDS) (e.g. Nextcloud, ownCloud, Seafile) to enable collaborative editing within their interface.

It has three editions - [Community, Enterprise, and Developer](#onlyoffice-docs-editions). 

\* Starting from version 6.0, Document Server is distributed under a new name - ONLYOFFICE Docs.
