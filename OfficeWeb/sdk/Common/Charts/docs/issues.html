    <p>
        These are some common issues that you should be aware of. If you're having trouble, you may want to look through these to see
        if any apply to you or may be the source of your problem.
    </p>


    <a name="requestAnnotationFrame"></a>
    <h4>Low animation frame rate in Chrome 15</h4>
        <p>
            In Chrome 15 the experimental function <i>requestAnimationFrame()</i> has a lower frame-rate than it does in Chrome 14.
            Not all animations are affected and animations that animate CSS properties using jQuery (eg the Line chart Trace
            animation) shouldn't be affected. The Odometer is particularly affected if you use tickmarks. In this you can turn off
            tickmarks and use the tickmark highlighting instead.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>Note:</b>
            A second release of Chrome 15 seems to have rectified the issue so you may not experience this.
        </p>

    <a name="annotations"></a>
    <h4>Annotations aren't saved when running locally in Mozilla Firefox</h4>

    <p>
        The solution here is to run the charts using a web server. At this time (March 2010) only Safari, Chrome and Opera
        support saving annotations when running locally.
    </p>


    <h4>Shadows in Google Chrome and the line chart</h4>

    <p>
        Shadows in recent versions of Google Chrome are somewhat broken. Firefox, MSIE, Opera and Safari are fine. The reason for this
        error is a combination of factors it seems - shadow blurring and line width. Fixes have been added to allow shadow blurring and
        a 1 pixel linewidth, though some chart types may still be affected.
