 13th January 2012 (STABLE)
 =================
  o [DOCS] Added HOWTO for making a transition effect
  o [GAUGE] The positioning of the titls has been tweaked slightly. You can now also override the positioning completely
            with chart.title.top.pos and chart.title.bottom.pos. These are decimals (which are null by default) and are
            multiplied with the radius to get the exact position.
  o [VPROGRESS} Properties to individually control the side title have been added:
                 o chart.title.side.bold
                 o chart.title.side.font
                 o chart.title.side.size
                 o chart.title.side.color

 6th January 2012
 ================
  o [LINE] Fixed slight bug with negative/filled Line charts: http://dev.OfficeExcel.net/tests/line/negative_filled.html
  o [LINE] Slight adjustment to the Trace effect - now the key is revealed as well as the lines.
  o [MISC] Fixed "conflict" with user events and tooltips
  o [MODALDIALOG]  The ModalDialog has been altered so that it is ALWAYS (re)created when it is shown - ie it is no
                   longer cached once it has been created

 30th December 2011
 ==================
  o [DOCS] Documented the Bar chart Wave2 effect
  o [GANTT] Y axis title is now bold by default
  o [GAUGE] Added chart.centerpin.radius
  o [GAUGE] Added chart.tickmarks.small
  o [GAUGE] Added chart.tickmarks.big
  o [GAUGE] Added chart.title.align (default is top)
  o [GAUGE] Added chart.title.x
  o [GAUGE] Added chart.title.y
  o [MISC] The test area is undergoing a revamp - if you would like me to add your chart to it please email it to
           me at the support address. Keep in mind that the chart should be self-contained, and that the actual data
           is largely irrelevant (so replace sensitive data with junk data). Keep in mind that the test area is not private.
 o [MISC] The two scale properties chart.scale.point and chart.scale.thousand have been synchronised across all chart libraries.

 18th December 2011
 ==================
  o [BAR] Added new background images properties:
           o chart.background.image.stretch
           o chart.background.image.x

  o [DOCS] Added HOWTO regarding the various linking methods
  o [DOCS] Added HOWTO regarding showing images in your charts
  o [DOCS] Documented all the new obj.getValue() methods
  o [DOCS] The dynamic example (http://www.OfficeExcel.net/docs/dynamic.html) scroll speed has been slowed down. This was
           done by simply increasing the number of data points shown from 100 to 250.
  o [EFFECTS] Added an opposite effect of Reveal - Conceal. These two effects can be combined to make a transition effect.
  o [LINE] Added new background images properties:
            o chart.background.image.stretch
            o chart.background.image.x
            o chart.background.image.y
            o chart.background.image.align
  o [MISC] The getValue() methods can either take an event object as its argument or a two element array
           of the coordinates to return the value for.
  o [SCATTER] Added new background images properties:
              o chart.background.image.stretch
              o chart.background.image.x
              o chart.background.image.y
              o chart.background.image.align

  o [LINE] Added a .getValue method to the Line chart
  o [LINE] If you use a larger than default font the line chart will now handle this
  o [RADAR] The Radar chart labels are no longer linked to the number of data points - ie you could have 12 datapoints
            but only 4 labels and the labels will be spaced equally around the Radar chart. The labels are also now
            place at a fixed radius around the chart.
  o [RADAR] Added chart.radius - allowing you to set the size of the Radar chart
  o [RADAR] The Radar chart .getPoint() method no longer checks to see if there is an appropriate tooltip defined

 =================
  o [BAR] Implemented chart.events.click and chart.events.mousemove
  o [BAR] Fixed chart.labels.above text appearing too low when used in-conjunction with chart.variant=3d
  o [EFFECTS] Implemented the wave2 effect, which utilises the requestAnimationFrame() and .bing() functions. Fallbacks are
              provided so that this effect works with Opera and Safari.
  o [LINE] Implemented chart.events.click and chart.events.mousemove
  o [PIE] Implemented chart.events.click and chart.events.mousemove
  o [PIE] When exploding segments they will now be drawn on top of the title
  o [RADAR] The origin is now the "North" axis, not the "East" axis

 26th November 2011 (STABLE)
 ==================
  o [ADJUSTING] The Rose chart adjusting has been removed
  o [DOCS] Added an example of financial data represented using the Scatter chart:
           http://www.OfficeExcel.net/docs/financial.html
  o [DOCS] Added an example of getting data from an XML file on the server
  o [EFFECTS] The slide in and slideout have each had the argument used to stipulate the direction renamed:
              OfficeExcel.Effects.jQuery.Slide.In(obj, {'from': 'right'});
              OfficeExcel.Effects.jQuery.Slide.Out(obj, {'to': left'});
  o [LED] Added more punctuation characters
  o [SCATTER] chart.boxplot.width is now a SCALE value, not a PIXEL value. Therefore, if your chart.xmax value is 28 (for four
              weeks say) 1 week would be represented by a value of 7, whereas before that would simply be 7 pixels.

 17th November 2011
 ==================
  o [KEY] Separated out the key functionality into its own file - OfficeExcel.common.key.js. If you use the key you will need to
          include this file. If you dn't use the key this will save roughly 30k.
  o [MISC] The charts libraries have a new technique that avoids you getting blurry lines that appear to be thicker than a
           single pixel. This roughly affects roughly 12 of the charts libraries.
  o [ZOOM] Added chart.zoom.mode.thumbnail.fixed that fixes the thumbnail zoom window in the top left of the canvas

 12th November 2011
 ==================
  o [DOCS] Added paragraph to miscellaneous docs regarding log scales.
  o [DONUT] The Donut chart is now done correctly instead of being a big white hole in the center of the Pie. If you use the
            Donut - check your charts, particularly if you use a coloured center as it is no longer coloured. If desired
            though, you can still get a coloured center by utilising the ondraw custom event to draw a big white circle
            that's half the radius in size. The shadow will now work correctly. For an example see here:
            http://www.OfficeExcel.net/examples/donut.html
  o [GAUGE] Added four new peoperties for controlling the colors: chart.border.inner
                                                                  chart.border.outer
                                                                  chart.centerpin.color
                                                                  chart.needle.color
  o [LINE] When tooltips are triggered by the mouse X position only, the cursor will now only change if it's actually
           over the point.
  o [MISC] IE7 is now supported with ExCanvas
  o [MISC] The latest stable Chrome (released on 10th November 2011 appears to be back up to speed when using the
           requestAnimationFrame() function - as such the Pie chart animation on the front page has been improved.
  o [PIE] There is now a Pie chart Wave effect
  o [PIE] IMPORTANT: The Pie chart .getSegment(e) method now returns angles measured in radians, not in degrees. Roughly, 1 radian = 57.29
          degrees (or 180/Math.PI ).
  o [ROSE] IMPORTANT: The Rose chart .getSegment(e) method now returns angles measured in radians, not in degrees. Roughly, 1 radian = 57.29
          degrees (or 180/Math.PI ).
  o [WEBSITE] There's now an example of the Pie chart RoundRobin and Implode effect on the front page of the website

 4th November 2011
 =================
  o [BAR] Added the Bar chart Wave animation. It's smoothest in MSIE9+ and FF7+
  o [FUEL] Rewrote the Fuel chart Grow animation. It now "Grows" from the last position - not zero all the time. NB To get
           rid of the flicker when using the Grow animation you must set chart.icon to null
  o [FUNNEL] Fixed the Funnel chart tapering when it shouldn't in MSIE
  o [HPROGRESS] Added the HProgress Grow animation
  o [LINE] Lines are now restroked (if they're filled and accumulative)
  o [VPROGRESS] Added the VProgress Grow effect

 27th October 2011
 ================
 o [BAR] The bar now has support for chart.colors.sequential with grouped and stacked charts
 o [MISC] Animations in Chrome 15 can be rather slower than Chrome 14. jQuery (ie CSS) based animations are unaffected, as are some
           canvas based animations.
 o [ROSE] The Rose chart Grow frame rate is now set at 60 frames over 1 second
  
 20th October 2011
 =================
  o [BAR] Added chart.ymin - regular and grouped bar charts are supported - not stacked
  o [LINE] Multiple filled Line charts now work with the Trace effect
  o [METER] Tweaked the Grow animation. Test your charts before upgrading (if you use the Grow animation)
  o [MISC] IMPORTANT: Default positioning for titles has changed - see .BC.txt file
  o [PIE] Added chart.key.interactive

 15th October 2011
 =================
  o [GAUGE} Added Grow effect. Like the Odo (now) it animates from the last reading, not zero all the time.
  o [LINE] Added FoldToCenter effect
  o [MISC] Converted crosshairs to use DOM2 event handling
  o [MISC] Added: chart.crosshairs.vlines
                  chart.crosshairs.hlines
  o [ODO] Changed Grow animation function so that it animates from the last reading - not constantly from zero
  o [PIE] Added .Explode() method to pie chart for programmatically exploding segments
  o [RADAR] Added Grow effect
  o [SCATTER] Added chart.ylabels.inside
  o [WATERFALL] Added Grow effect

 11th October 2011
 =================
  o [NOTE] The Pie chart chart.segments array is being removed (probably November or December) - use obj.angles instead.
  o [PIE] IMPORTANT: The Pie chart has been altered so that the start point is now the "north"axis. Please check your
          charts - particularly if you use the Pie chart internals. If you want to stick with the older version of the
          Pie chart - it's in the libraries/ folder named OfficeExcel.pie.js.old and will be there for a few releases.
          You're highly recommended to use the newer version though as the old version will bew only kept for a few
          months.
 o [PIE] Added OfficeExcel.Effects.Pie.Implode animation - combining it with the RoundRobin animation looks good
 o [ROSE] The Rose chart Grow animation also now gradually increases the angle of the segments as well as their size. See
          this page for an example: http://www.OfficeExcel.net/examples/index.html Regular and stacked Rose charts are supported

 8th October 2011
 ================
  o [HBAR] Added easing to the HBar grow effect - the effect is very subtle
  o [PIE] Added RoundRobin effect
  o [MISC] Added chart.title.font  chart.title.xaxis.font  chart.title.yaxis.font
                 chart.title.size  chart.title.xaxis.size  chart.title.yaxis.size

 ================
  o [FUNNEL] Added chart.taper for Funnels that don't taper to a point
  o [FUNNEL] Added chart.labels.sticks that shows indicator lines for the labels
  o [GANTT] Added the ability to have multiple "events" per line. For an example see here:
            http://www.OfficeExcel.net/examples/gantt.html
            Note that if you start adding multiple events then the tooltips order may need attention
 o [GAUGE] Added Gauge chart - another meter variant
 o [LINE] Added chart.tooltips.hotspot.xonly. This makes the tooltips trigger by the X mouse position only
 o [MISC] Not very noticable, but the snap tooltip effect now uses jQuery if it's available.
 o [ODO] Note that Firefox 7 had issue with the gradient used in the Odometer border - so you may find that it has changed very
         very slightly
 o [PIE] Fixed a pie chart bug which presented itself when clicking canvas tags that had nothing to do with OfficeExcel

 24th September 2011
 ===================
 o [WEBSITE] Social icons updated

 22nd September 2011 (STABLE)
 ===================
 o [DOCS] Documented how to retrieve just the PNG image from the canvas

 o [METER] Fixed little bug with Meter chart grow animation not respecting minimum value
 o [MISC] STABLE release
 o [SCATTER DOCS] Documented chart.line.linewidth
 o [WEBSITE] Added testimonial from Cisco Ireland

 18th September 2011
 ===================
  o [LICENSE] If you want to buy multiple licenses (eg you're a web designer with multiple clients that you want
              to get OfficeExcel licenses for), then there's now a bulk licenses option with the discount increasing
              the more you buy. If you're interested in this then you can inquire about it by emailing
              licensing@OfficeExcel.net
  o [LINE] Filled line charts and the X axis at the top now works correctly
  o [METER] Added Meter chart Grow effect

 12th September 2011
 ===================
  o [HBAR] chart.background.grid.autofit has been turned on by default.
  o [LINE] Added chart.curvy and chart.curvy.factor. Curvy lines are NOT exact, and the inaccuracy increases with
           the severity of the curve. chart.curvy.factor can be a decimal from 0 (not curvy) to 0.5 (quite curvy)

 9th September 2011
 ==================
  o [BAR] The background grid autofit has been turned on by default. The number of horizontal grid lines has been
          changed to 5.
  o [EFFECTS] Fade in now operates over a period of 0.5 seconds
  o [LICENSE] Revamped the license page - this should make it clearer
  o [LINE] Added UnfoldFromCenter() animation
  o [LINE] The background grid autofit has been turned on by default. The number of horizontal grid lines has been
           changed to 5.
  o [ODO] Added Grow animation effect
  o [PIE ZOOM] A change has been made to the Pie chart when using tooltips and the full canvas zoom - please test your charts
               if you're upgrading and you use tooltips in conjunction with the zoom.
  o [PIE] Fixed a Pie chart label/seperation bug where chart.exploded is a number
  o [ROSE] Added Grow() animation. This only works with regular and stacked Rose charts.
  o [SCATTER] You can now have an X scale. If you specify that the X axis should be scaled then you don't have to specify an
              xmax - one will be calculated for you. It may not be what you want though - so you might have to specify the
              xmax anyway.
  o [SCATTER] Minor bug fixed when hiding the lest tick when the X axis is at the right
  o [SCATTER] The background grid autofit has been turned on by default. The number of horizontal grid lines has been
              changed to 5.
  o [WATERFALL] Added ability to have the X axis in the center
  o [WATERFALL] The Waterfall property chart.background.grid.autofit now defaults to true (instead of false)
  o [ZOOM] Changed the frame rate for the full canvas zoom

 30th August 2011
 ================
  o [LINE] Added chart.animation.unfold.initial
  o [MISC] Support is now via email - support@OfficeExcel.net - not the forum

 27th August 2011 (STABLE)
 ================
  o [MISC] Stable release

 25th August 2011
 ================
  o [WEBSITE] Misc website changes

 22nd August 2011
 ================
  o [LINE] Added OfficeExcel.Effects.Line.Rise(obj) animation function. This is a nice effect made simple because of the
           .Animate() function
  o [LINE] A bug has been fixed for stepped line chart, but please be cautious when upgrading

 20th August 2011
 ================
  o [MISC] Changed the OfficeExcel.Clear() method to use .clearRect() method
  o [LINE] IMPORTANT Significant change to the way that filled multi-line charts are drawn. Formerly
           the lines were stacked on top of each other. Normally this wasn't too much of an issue
           unless you wanted semi-transparent colours. Because the lines were stacked on top of
           each other the colors wouldn't be exactly right. This has now changed so you CAN now use
           semi-transparent colors.
           
           As a result the order in which the lines are drawn has been changed, so whilst the data
           will remain the same, the "stacking" order if the datasets may change. Also, if you use
           an array of shadow colors, they may need reversing.
 o [MISC] The download archive now works "out-of-the-box" with IE9. Formerly the DOCTYPE wasn't the first line
          in the files so it choked. Only offline IE9 was affected.
 o [MISC] Added showcase of requestAnimationFrame(): http://dev.OfficeExcel.net/tests/anim.html

 13th August 2011
 ================
  o [BAR] Added chart.numyticks
  o [HPROGRESS] Added .getBar method
  o [HPROGRESS] Added chart.strokestyle
  o [LINE] Added chart.numyticks

  o [RADAR] Added chart.labels.specific
  o [RSCATTER} Converted to use a .getPoint(e) method for tooltips
  o [SCATTER} Completely removed chart.tooltips.coords.adjust
  o [SCATTER] Added chart.numyticks
  o [VPROGRESS] Added .getBar method

  o [WATERFALL] Added .getBar(e) method for tooltips

 10th August 2011
 ================
  o [ANIM] Revamped the animation page and added the OfficeExcel.Effects object. This allows you to add animation and wipes
           to your OfficeExcel charts.

 6th August 2011
 ===============
  o [BAR LINE] Tooltips highlighting now works with combined bar/line charts
  o [METER] Added chart.centery, chart.centery and chart.radius
  o [METER] Added chart.colors.ranges - an alternative to the red/yellow/green areas
  o [METER] Added chart.strokestyle - default is null
  o [SCATTER] Added chart.boxplot.capped - this controls the horizontal lines at the end of boxplots
  o [THERMOMETER] The thermometer now supports a scale with chart.scale.visible, chart.scale.decimals and chart.ylabels.count
  o [TOOLTIPS] The internal function OfficeExcel.getTooltipText() has been renamed to OfficeExcel.getTooltipTextFromDIV()
  o [WEBSITE] Added animation samples to front page and example index page

 29th July 2011 (STABLE)
 ==============
  o [BAR] Added chart.noendxtick
  o [BAR] Fixed a bug with specific labels vertical positioning with a center X axis
  o [LINE] Documented chart.noendxtick
  o [LINE] Added chart.tickmarks.linewidth
  o [LINE] When using specific labels and a ymin, the first label is now placed where "0" would go

 25th July 2011
 ==============
  o [CONTEXT] Added onbeforecontextmenu OfficeExcel event
  o [KEY] Noted Line chart interactive key
  o [PIE] Shadow now works correctly with exploded segments
  o [SCATTER] Added chart.labels.above, chart.labels.above.size and chart.labels.above.decimals to the Scatter chart
  

 20th July 2011
 ==============
   o [BIPOLAR] Converted tooltips to use the new obj.getBar(e) method.
   o [PIE] The option chart.exploded can now be a number, which is then applied to each segment (as well as the prior array)
   o [PIE] Outlining now works with exploded segments - http://www.OfficeExcel.net/docs/you-dont-need-to-spend-a-lot-of-money.html
   o [BAR] When adding a line chart on top of a bar chart, the following are no longer set.
            If you want them you will need to set them yourself (the former values are also shown):

              line.Set('chart.noaxes', true);
              line.Set('chart.background.barcolor1', 'rgba(0,0,0,0)');
              line.Set('chart.background.barcolor2', 'rgba(0,0,0,0)');
              line.Set('chart.background.grid', false);
              line.Set('chart.ylabels', false);
            
            There are a few things that are still set for you:
            
              chart.gutter.top
              chart.gutter.bottom
              chart.gutter.left
              chart.gutter.right
              chart.ymax

  o [FUNNEL] Converted tooltips to use the new obj.getSegment(e) method.
  o [LINE] The Line chart now has a .__index2__ property which can be used in your ontooltip event handlers. This is the index
           in the individual array for a particular line. If you're not using multiple lines in your chart, this won't affect
           you.

 17th July 2011
 ==============
  o [BAR] Added chart.colors.reverse for reversing the order in which colors are used (stacked bar charts only)
  o [FUNNEL] Added a .getSegment(e) method - which greatly simplifies retrieving the segment that has
             been clicked on (or the mouse is over etc).
  o [LINE] Added chart.key.interactive - this allows you click on a key item and it will be highlighted on the chart
  o [TOOLTIPS] Small fix to snap effect when you have multiple charts one one page, both with tooltips
  o [TOOLTIPS] The default CSS has been altered for tooltips. This affects all chart types. The changes are:
                o There is now no CSS border to the tooltip
                o The toltip is now transparent a small amount (opacity=0.9)
                o The tooltip shadow X & Y offsets are now zero

 12th July 2011
 ==============
  o [MISC] Stable release

 11th July 2011
 ==============
  o [WEBSITE] Website updates

 10th July 2011
 ==============
  o [CONTEXT] Added the registry variable: OfficeExcel.Registry.Get('chart.contextmenu').__shape__
              This is the underlying hotspot (eg bar/segment/point), if any, that was clicked on.

              Objects that have a .getXXX() method now also have a .getShape() method, which is
              exactly the same, but can be used if you don't know what object type you have,
              (since it's the same name across all object types).

 8th July 2011
 =============
  o [DOCS] Documentation updates
  o [COMMON] Fixed a slight bug when formatting negative numbers at 1,000 and over
  o [METER] Added Meter options: chart.value.label
                                 chart.value.text.decimals
                                 chart.value.text.units.pre
                                 chart.value.text.units.post

 29th June 2011
 ==============
  o [WEBSITE] Website changes

 28th June 2011
 ==============
  o [RADAR] The Tradar has been renamed to Radar - you WILL need to update your code slightly.
  o [RADAR] Fixed a bug with tooltips and multiple datasets
  o [TOOLTIPS] The 'snap' effect now snaps on the first view, moving in from the top left - see the front page line chart
               for an example of its use.

 25th June 2011
 ==============
  o [LINE] "10 labels" with a chart.ymin value now works with X axis at the top and bottom
  o [PIE] The chart.tooltips.coords.adjust property has been removed
  o [ZOOM] Added ability to fire the full canvas zoom by just a click - no context menu

 23rd June 2011
 ==============
  o [LINE] The chart.tooltips.coords.adjust property has been removed
  o [ROSE] The Rose chart getSegment() return value has changed. Instead of just one radius value, there are now two
           radius values - the start and end values. This change was necessary to facilitate stacked Rose charts.
           Subsequent values have "moved up one" in the array (ie what was index 3 is now 4, what was 4 is now 5
           and what was 5 is now 6)
  o [SCATTER] The chart.tooltips.coords.adjust property has been removed

 21st June 2011
 ==============
 o [DONUT] Added chart.variant.donut.color for the center hole
 o [HBAR] The default colors have changed
 o [HBAR] Added sequential color support to grouped and stacked HBars

 18th June 2011
 ==============
  o [HBAR] Added chart.colors.sequential for regular hbars (not stacked or grouped)
  o [HBAR] Converted to .getBar(e) method for tooltips
  o [LINE] Added triangle and filledtriangle tickmark types
  o [ODO] Added chart.green.solid and documented
  o [ODO] Added chart.yellow.solid and documented
  o [ODO] Added chart.red.solid and documented
  o [ODO] Documented chart.green.color
  o [ODO] Documented chart.yellow.color
  o [ODO] Documented chart.red.color
  o [PIE] Added chart.variant.donut.color - this controls the color of the hole
  o [ROSE] Implemented stacked Rose chart (see below)
  o [ROSE] Added chart.colors.sequential (which, if you upgrade, you need to set to true to maintain BC)
  o [ROSE] When using tooltips, the highlight will now appear "over" the axis labels. This makes the
           highlighted segment more identifiable.
  o [ROSE] Tooltips can now be a single function, or an array of functions as well as an array of strings
  o [ROSE] Added chart.variant - the value can be either null (for a normal or stacked Rose chart) or "non-equi-angular" for a
           Rose chart that has unequal segment sizes. See an example here:

           http://dev.OfficeExcel.net/tests/2011-07-30/non-equi-angular_rose.html
    
  o [ROSE] Added chart.labels.offset
  o [ROSE] Added chart.tooltips.event
  o [SCATTER] Added in-graph labels to Scatter chart
  
    The Rose chart has undergone significant changes in order to facilitate stacked and non-equi-angular charts.
    In particular, the color handling has changed, and as such you may need to specify chart.colors.sequential in
    your chart configurtion to get the colors to behave as they used to. Changing the way colors behave brings the Rose chart
    into line with other chart types. Also, the Rose chart .getSegment() return value has changed - now instead of just one radius
    value, you get a start radius and end radius value.

 7th June 1011
 =============
  o [LINE] Documented chart.filled.accumulative
  o [WEBSITE] Removed redundant checks from graph libraries

 4th June 2011 (STABLE)
 =============
  o [MISC] Stable release - see .BC.txt, and look through this files entries since the last stable release (25-03-2011)
 
 28th May 2011
 =============
  o [LINE] You may need to adjust your titles vertical positioning using chart.title.vpos
  o [MISC] Added example of adding a subtitle to your graph

 21st May 2011
 =============
  o [BIPOLAR] Tooltip handling has changed. If none is set for a particular bar, none will now be shown
  o [COMMON] Check your graph titles - the vertical positioning has changed. To reposition you can
             use chart.title.vpos
  o [HBAR]The X axis title positioning may have changed slightly - if you use it you should check your title is as you expect
  o [HBAR] chart.labels.above has been fixed in respect of drawing text in a stacked HBar for sections that it shouldn't do
  o [HBAR] Fixed a very minor bug when the chart is redrawn (after being drawn once) and the scale wasn't correctly reset
  o [LINE] This chart type may be particularly buggy because of the gutter changes
  o [MISC] Individual gutters are now settable with all graph types
  o [MISC] The settings chart.width and chart.height are now deprecated in favour of the new individual gutter settings
  o [ODO] Added key - helpful for multiple pointers
  o [RESIZE] Repositioning the resize handle is no longer necessary with the introduction of independent gutter settings.
             Starting with the May release this setting should no longer be used.
  o [SCATTER] Added an obj.getPoint(e) method which eases getting the point (if any) that is currently being hovered over
  o [WATERFALL] Documented chart.scale.formatter

       Keep in mind that individual gutter settings and using chart.width/chart.height are not meant
       to be used together - chart.width/chart.height will cease to be user facing properties and will
       (starting this release) stop functioning and be removed completely. The addition of individual
       gutter settings is a fundamental change so testing of your graphs is imperative. The
       requirement of translating to reclaim lost space is reduced (if not eliminated
       entirely) with the addition of these settings.

 7th May 2011
 ============
  o [API] Added OfficeExcel.Reset() function, which both clears the canvas AND resets any .translate() that has been performed
  o [INVOICE] Improved the appearance of the invoice
  o [LINE] Added individual gutter settings:

             chart.gutter.right
             chart.gutter.top
             chart.gutter.bottom
            Keep in mind that these settings are experimental currently. In particular they may cause dynamic features
            not to work 100% correctly.
  o [MODALDIALOG] Added an example of covering the scroll bars to the ModalDialog page
  o [ODO] Kength of extra pointers is now supported, eg: odo.Set('chart.needle.extra', [[16, 'yellow', 50]]);
  o [WATERFALL] Added this new chart type
  o [WEBSITE] Changed pages to use uncompressed version of ExCanvas - now works offline

 30th April 2011

  o [LINE] Added support for chart.background.image
  o [LINE] Added ability to have X axis at the top for entirely negative data sets, eg:
           obj.Set('chart.xaxispos', 'top');
  o [MSIE] MSIE 8 now clears to white by default, not transparent
  o [PIE] Added chart.tooltips.coords.adjust
  o [PIE] Segment separation is now available as a tooltip highlight mode (exploded segments)

  o [MSIE] Positioning tweaks for IE9 final

 20th March 2011
 ===============
  o [LINE] Added workaround for Chrome bug when specifying different line widths for lines
  o [MISC] Added chart.key.halign (when using graph mode) which can be left or right (default)
  o [TRADAR] Fixed tradar and interactive adjusting (thrown out by the addition of multiple datasets)

 12th March 2011
 ===============
  o [COMMON] The OfficeExcel.Clear() function has been changed to a transparent colour to transparent instead of white. Also,
             a new event has been added called onclear which fires when the function is called. You can use this function
             to draw a white (or a color of your choice) rectangle over the canvas. Effectively clearing the canvas to
             your color, for example:

            function myClear(obj)
            {
                obj.context.beginPath();
                obj.context.fillStyle = 'white';
                obj.context.fillRect(-10,-10,obj.canvas.width + 20, obj.canvas.height + 20);
                obj.context.fill();
            }

            DO NOT simply use the OfficeExcel.Clear() function in the onclear event listener function, as you will create an
            infinite loop.
  o [COMMON] Added chart.title.yaxis.align to the common background code. This is usable by:
              - Bar
              - Line
              - Scatter
  o [LINE] A bug has been fixed that is apparent when you're using chart.outofbounds and have null values. If you have this
           combination, please test your graphs! An example is here: http://dev.OfficeExcel.net/tests/null.html
  o [ODO] Added chart.border.color1
  o [ODO] Added chart.border.color2
  o [ODO] Added chart.border.color3
  o [ROSE] Corrected a bug in the Rose chart, introduced in the prior beta

             chart.tickmarks.small.color
             chart.tickmarks.big.color
  o [RESIZING] Tooltips for the icons are now limited to Google Chrome and MSIE because of reliability issues. The cursor will
               still change in all browsers though
  o [THERMOMETER] Added chart.title.side
  o [TRADAR] Added multiple dataset support. eg: http://www.OfficeExcel.net/examples/tradar.html
  o [TRADAR] Added key

 5th March 2011
 ==============
  o [COMMON] The default color for by the OfficeExcel.Clear() function has been changed to transparent.
  o [COMMON] The OfficeExcel.getSegment() function has been moved to  be a method of both the Rose and the Pie charts, instead of part
             of the common object. ie Supposing your object is called myObj, it will now be myObj.getSegment(e), instead of
             OfficeExcel.getSegment(e)
  o [INVOICE] Added Paypal button to invoice
  o [PIE] Added exploded segments. http://www.OfficeExcel.net/docs/animation_segments.html Certain Pie chart options won't work

 23rd October 2010
 =================
  
  Important:
            The Line (and Scatter chart) chart have been PARTIALLY REVERTED, meaning that the number of labels is again a
            choice between 1/3/5. The option to have 10 labels will be re-added, but for positive charts only, and
            probably for scales with maximum values over 10.

    | Every single one of the property names has been changed to be a little more unified. The new format is now       |
    | "chart.xxx" where xxx is the actual name. Some of the names have been changed completely, eg. "chart.text.size", |
    | which was formerly "textheight", whilst others only marginally. This was necessary to bring some semblance of    |
    | uniformity to the OfficeExcel properties across all of the libraries, make it look a bit more "proffessional" and     |
    | provide plenty of scope for future properties.                                                                   |
    |                                                                                                                  |
    | You should also note that as of this release (14th March 2009) that OfficeExcel has been changed to use the canvas    |
    | text and shadow APIs. This may mean you needing to upgrade your browser if you want to use the latest version.   |
    | At the time of writing, this meant Firefox 3.1b2, Safari 4 and Chrome 2. If you don't wish to upgrade your       |
    | browser, or need Opera support, then you will need to remain on the 28th February 2009 version.                  |
