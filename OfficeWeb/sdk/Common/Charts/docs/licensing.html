        <p>
            A simple and straight-forward overview of the licensing is that for <a href="#license.commercial">commercial</a> use there
            is a single licensing fee of <b>&pound;79</b> (GBP) (which is approximately $120 USD)
            whilst for <a href="#license.free">non-commercial use</a> (eg personal, government, charity, educational etc) it's free
            to use assuming that you link to <a href="http://www.OfficeExcel.net" target="_blank">www.OfficeExcel.net</a> on your website.
        </p>

    <a name="license.commercial"></a>
    &nbsp;<br /><br />
    <h2>Commercial <span>usage</span></h2>
    
        <p>
            Commercial usage covers commercial entities for their websites
            (either internal or external) or in software that they produce. If your organisation generates
            profit then a commercial license is most appropriate. There are some legal terms  and FAQs below that
            should help to answer any questions that you may have, but if they don't then you can
            email your question to: <a href="mailto:support@OfficeExcel.net"><b>support@OfficeExcel.net</b></a>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            After completion of either Google Checkout or Paypal payment you are granted an OfficeExcel commercial license. You will
            be sent the license details via email.
        </p>

        <p>
            Example uses are:
            
            <ul>
                <li>Internal websites (eg intranets)</li>
                <li>Private websites</li>
                <li>Public facing websites</li>
                <li>Online applications</li>
                <li>Offline applications</li>
            </ul>
            
            
            You may alter the OfficeExcel code to suit your particular needs. Also, if you're covered by the non-commercial license, however
            you don't wish to link to the OfficeExcel website then buying a commercial license means that you dont have to.

            &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
            <b>Do I need to buy a commercial license?</b><br />
            For commercial/business use, then yes - you need a license to use OfficeExcel.
            
            <br /><br />
            
            <a name="how.many.licenses.do.i.need"></a>
            &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
            <b>How many licenses do I need?</b><br />
            Regardless of how much you use OfficeExcel in your organisation or in the software you make, you are only required to
            buy one OfficeExcel license.
            <br /><br />

            <a name="how.much.is.a.license"></a>
            &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
            <b>How much is a license?</b><br />
            An OfficeExcel license costs <b>&pound;79</b> (UK pounds). That's a little over $120 (US dollars) at
            the time of writing.
    
            <br /><br />

            &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
            <b>What if I need something that's not part of OfficeExcel?</b><br />
            If there's a feature that you need that's not part of OfficeExcel then you can usually be accommodated assuming that
            you're a license holder. Please <a href="#contact">contact support</a> first to discuss your needs. If it's not too specific
            to you then it can be added to the main OfficeExcel software. If it is then it can be added to your specific copy of OfficeExcel. You can
            contact support with <a href="mailto:support@OfficeExcel.net">support@OfficeExcel.net</a>
            
            <br /><br />
    
            <a name="what.does.the.license.cover"></a>
            &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
            <b>What does the license cover?</b><br />
            The OfficeExcel license covers OfficeExcel as a whole. Excepting ExCanvas, all code that you find in the OfficeExcel archive is
            covered by the OfficeExcel license.
    
            <br /><br />
            
            <a name="what.if.im.a.web.designer"></a>
            &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
            <b>What if I'm a web designer?</b><br />
            In this situation each client would need a separate license for themselves. They can then use OfficeExcel as much as they wish.
            If you prefer to buy in bulk - discounts are available.

            <br /><br />
            
            <a name="open.source.projects"></a>
            &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
            <b>Can I include OfficeExcel in an Open Source project?</b><br />
            You're not prohibited from using OfficeExcel in Open source projects, however you need to be aware of two things:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The license you choose for your project may be incompatible with commercial software. The GPL is a prime
                    example of this. Read your license carefully to find out whether you can use commercial software with it.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    If you don't want any commercial users of your software to be liable for an OfficeExcel license you can buy
                    an OfficeExcel license to cover your software specifically.

                    <!-- Any commercial users of your software will be liable for a commercial OfficeExcel license. -->
                </li>
            </ol>

            <a name="bulk.discount"></a>
            &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
            <b>Is there a discount for buying licenses in bulk?</b><br />
            Yes there's a discount available if you wish to buy 5, 10 or 15 licenses (you could be a web designer for example
            wishing to license your clients). Please <a href="#contact">contact support</a> if this interests you.

            <br /><br />
            
            <a name="authoring.tools"></a>
            &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
            <b>What if I make an authoring tool?</b><br />
            If you make an authoring tool then you can include OfficeExcel with your software but each and every commercial Customer
            who makes use of it would be liable to buy their own full-price license.

            <br /><br />

            <a name="do.i.need.to.provide.a.backlink"></a>
            &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
            <b>Do I need to provide a backlink?</b><br />
            Commercial license holders do not need to provide a backlink to the OfficeExcel website.
    
            <br /><br />

            <a name="can.you.send.me.an.invoice"></a>
            &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
            <b>Can you send me an invoice?</b><br />
            Of course, simply go here: <a href="http://www.OfficeExcel.net/invoice.html">http://www.OfficeExcel.net/invoice.html</a>, enter your email
            address and you'll be sent an invoice that you can use for tax purposes.
        </p>
    
    <a name="license.free"></a>
    &nbsp;<br /><br />
    <h2>Non-commercial <span>free usage</span></h2>
        <p>
            OfficeExcel can be used free-of-charge by non-commercial entities who wish to use it either on an internal or external website
            or in software that they make assuming that you link back to the OfficeExcel website. Examples of non-commercial entities
            include:
    
                <ul>
                    <li>Individuals</li>
                    <li>Charities</li>
                    <li>Government bodies</li>
                    <li>Educational institutes</li>
                </ul>
    
            Sample HTML for a link is:
        </p>
    
    <pre class="code">
&lt;a href="http://www.OfficeExcel.net" target="_blank"&gt;
    Charts made with OfficeExcel: HTML5 Javascript charts library
&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

    <p>
        If you would prefer not to link to the OfficeExcel website, then you can buy an OfficeExcel commercial license and you won't need to.
        You may alter the OfficeExcel code to suit your particular needs.
    </p>

&lt;a href="http://www.OfficeExcel.net" target="_blank"&gt;
    Charts made with OfficeExcel: HTML5 Javascript charts library
&lt;/a>&gt;
</pre>
                
                   Alternatively, if you don't wish to link to the OfficeExcel website, you can
                   buy an OfficeExcel license and you won't need to.
            </li>
