			<p><b>ONLYOFFICE&trade; Spreadsheet Editor</b> offers you the possibility to work at a spreadsheet collaboratively with other users. This feature includes:</p>

			<h3>Co-editing</h3>
			<p>When a spreadsheet is being edited by several users simultaneously, the edited cells as well as the tab of the sheet where these cells are situated are marked with dashed lines of different colors. Hover the mouse cursor over one of the edited cells to display the name of the user who is editing it at the moment. The number of users who are working at the current document is specified in the right lower corner at the bottom bar - <img alt="Number of users icon" src="../images/usersnumber.png" />.</p>
			<p>As soon as one of the users saves his/her changes, the others will see a note in the upper left corner stating that they have updates. To save the changes made and get the updates, click the <img alt="Save icon" src="../images/saveupdate.png" /> icon in the left upper corner of the top toolbar.</p>
